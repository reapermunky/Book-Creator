This script takes a topic, forces AI to generate an outline, writes the chapters, slaps a cover on it, and compiles it into a full EPUB. Effort required: none. Ethics? Questionable.

How it works:
Enter a topic. Could be "The Art of Picking Your Nose".

AI pretends to care and generates an outline.

Chapters appear out of nowhere. Some might even be decent.

A book cover gets slapped together. It’s ugly, but it counts.

The whole thing compiles into an EPUB, ready to sell, frame, or whatever.

What you do with it is up to you.
Flood Amazon with AI-generated self-help books.

Create the most cursed horror novel imaginable.

Spam an entire bookshelf with niche manifestos.

Trick your friends into thinking you spent months writing.

The point isn’t writing. The point is automation. Have fun.
